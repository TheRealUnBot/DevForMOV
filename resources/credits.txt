Welcome to September 22!
I need to ask all of you a favor.
Today is the birthday of my good friend Greta Temme
Without her, I may or may not still be here. 
So if you guys have enjoyed this server so far,
please send a email to 149097@student.vansd.org,
tell her: "Happy Birthday, from a user of Unknown Bot Tech"
Thank you all!!
If its not Sep 22, don't send this!
